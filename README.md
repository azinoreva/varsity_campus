![Python Version](./images/python_versio.png)

**Note**: After installing the latest version of the python, then;
```shell
* **clone the repository**:$ git clone https://{*YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN*}/{*YOUR_USERNAME}/varsity_campus.git.
$ cd varsity_campus
```
### Create an environment
```shell
$ cd varsity_campus
$ python3 -m venv/bin/activate for (macOS/Linux) users.
$ source venv/bin/activate for window users.
```

### Installing flask

Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Flask:
```shell
$ pip install Flask
```
Then run the *flask* using this command.
```shell
$ python3 -m flask run
or
$ flask run
or
$ flask run --debug
```
### Dependencies:
These distributions will be installed automatically when installing Flask.

* [Werkzeug](https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/) implements WSGI, the standard Python interface between applications and servers.

* [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) is a template language that renders the pages your application serves.

* [MarkupSafe](https://palletsprojects.com/p/markupsafe/) comes with Jinja. It escapes untrusted input when rendering templates to avoid injection attacks.

* [ItsDangerous](https://palletsprojects.com/p/itsdangerous/) securely signs data to ensure its integrity. This is used to protect Flaskâ€™s session cookie.

* [Click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/) is a framework for writing command line applications. It provides the *flask* command and allows adding custom management commands.

* [Blinker](https://blinker.readthedocs.io/) provides support for [Signals.](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/signals/)

### Optional dependencies
These distributions will not be installed automatically. Flask will detect and use them if you install them.

* [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv#readme) enables support for Environment Variables From dotenv when running flask commands.

* [Watchdog](https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/) provides a faster, more efficient reloader for the development server.
